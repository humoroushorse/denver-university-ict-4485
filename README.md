# Welcome to the ICT-4485 final project!

## Running the code

CD into ict_4485_week_10 and run the following

```bash
poetry install
```
This only really needs to be done once unless you add dependencies or make major changes to the project


```bash
poetry run python3 ict_4485_week_10/main.py
```

This will serve the project
